Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to structure code. It allows developers to organize data and behavior into reusable and modular units.

Key Concepts of OOP:

Objects → Real-world entities with properties (data) and methods (functions).

Classes → Blueprints for creating objects.

Encapsulation → Keeping data private inside objects.

Inheritance → Reusing properties and methods from a parent class.

Polymorphism → Overriding methods for different behavior.

Abstraction → Hiding implementation details.
